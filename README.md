# Machine Learning Model Comparison

This project compares the performance of various machine learning models on a classification dataset. The models evaluated include Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree. The dataset is preprocessed, and the models are trained, evaluated, and compared based on their performance metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is assumed to be in a CSV file named `dataset.csv`. It contains several features and a target class column. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and normalize the features.

## Model Evaluated

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Performance Metrics

The models are evaluated based on the following metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix

## Prerequisites

To run the code, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- scikit-learn (sklearn)
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
